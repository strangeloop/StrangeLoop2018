    GEOFF: Hi.  So, Bridget asked me to submit a title for my talk a few months ago.  And I did.  And then things got really exciting at work.  So, now my talk has a new title, as evidenced by the strikethrough.  Hi.
    Hi, I'm Geoff.  I work at CommonLit, a 501c3 nonprofit and I love DC.  Outside of the weather ten months of the year, DC's actually a really nice place.
    [ Laughter ]
    We're entering one of the two months where DC's weather is tolerable.  And the other is March where we have the cherry blossom festival.  If you want to experience Washington, D.C. completely free of the taint of politics, I would highly you recommend DC in the month of March.  It's really lovely.  Let's see.  I'm a little bit nervous speaking in front of this crowd.  So, I'm going to cheat and leverage two funny photos of my kids.
    This is Alex.  He's 2 years old.  And his favorite question to ask right now about things is whether or not different animals have hands.  And I've realized that it's getting a little confusing, the difference between a hoof and a paw and a hand and a flipper.  And this is Julia, 11 weeks old.  And I'm going to be taking several weeks off of work starting on Monday to take care of her.  So those are my kids and now you feel sympathetic towards me.
    All right.  Back to business.  Let's talk about CommonLit.  CommonLit delivers high quality free instructional materials for kids in grades 6-12.  What this means is it's curated texts that we acquire the rights to.  We get them from publishers, hey, can you donate this article from the economist or a chapter from a book.  Or maybe 35% of the stuff is from the public domain.  We don't need to acquire the rights to it.  We just get it.
    And in about 25-35% of cases we have some need in our matrix of reading levels and content types or literary devices or thing like that.  And we go and commission writers to go and write pieces for us.  After we acquire the texts, we have a team of teachers who write rigorous questions.  It helps the students understand what they have read and they are from standards, common core, the state standards.  They help teachers get a little bit of like advanced warning about how well their kids are doing about the standards that they're inevitably going to get tested on if they're going to graduate.
    All right.  So, let's start with a story.  This was what Michelle Brown, the founder of CommonLit, found when she showed up for her first day of teaching English at a school in the poorest county of Mississippi.  It's not just bad facilities.  Even after she cleaned up the trash and moved the desks into a sort of logical arrangement.  She didn't have access to materials for her students.
    Like, there was nothing for them to read in English class.  So, Michelle, I hope you all get a chance to meet her someday.  She's a really incredible person.  But she did what she always does.  She tapped into her deep resourcefulness and she went and like begged, borrowing and stealing to find content for her kids to read.  In some cases, this involved sneaking to the library at night and photo copying at books.  We will not talk about that outside of this conference.
    But this had like a really like deep effect on her.  And several teachers that she met later who had been in similar environments, about the need for like finding a way to early and aggressively get kids the resources that they need in order to learn and receive an education and have an opportunity to have a job that will be safe and stable in the future.
    This is like - I mean, like getting - getting these sorts of skills is like the difference between having a job that will be made obsolete and having no economic opportunity or being involved in like the service economy where like as supply goes up and demand doesn't change, like your prospects may start to dwindle just because there's a lot of people who may be trying to do the same thing you are.
    The skills that I'm talking about here are like the ability to read a complex text.  To understand the author's argument.  To maybe parse their angle or bias.  And then to be able to respond to that with an argument of their own.  So, that's like the mission of CommonLit is to spread these skills to students so that they can have an opportunity in the future.
    So, Michelle finishes Teach for America.  She goes to grad school.  While she's in grad school, her thesis, basically, is CommonLit.  She like dreams up the thesis.  And the initial products that got built in CommonLit was actually like the former product consultant in me was so proud.  It was like no tech at all.  It was just PDFs.  And then those PDFs had a text that she had acquired the rights to and then study questions the teachers could distribute and then get, you know, print outs.  Students fill it in, they give it back.  The teachers grade it.
    This very quickly started to evolve into, now we'll have a website with the PDFs on it so the teachers and students can get the content online.  This - despite its lo-fi nature, resonated with teachers.  A lot of it was teachers didn't have access to good or fun things to read so students - teachers who used CommonLit felt their students were engaged and excited and the teachers saw results.
    So, I'm the CTO of an organization that does something more than just downloading PDFs.  Let's talk about what happened next.  Teachers increasingly started telling the CommonLit team that they had access to computers in the classroom.  They were doing CommonLit assignments but reading the PDFs on computers in the computer lab.  A lot of schools have what's now essentially a computer cart.  A cart with 25 Chromebooks in it.  And they push with the cart around, and it has a charger and from class to class the computers get passed around.  These are low-power machines, but they were perfectly capable of driving a modern web app.
    Our library now has 1500 texts in two languages.  It's fully searchable.  So, teachers can say, like, well, I'm looking for seventh grade reading level text that is in science fiction genre and grapples with the theme of teenage loneliness.  I'm not sure if question exactly have that text, but that's an example of how specific you might get if you were running through our library.
    But the really, really powerful thing that started to happen in addition to teachers just getting access to more texts because we now had a digital library and they could dig in is that now like assignments and grading - our digital assignments platform - gave teachers the ability to see their students' progress over time.  Now the data that the teachers have for their students say, okay, I can see the student doing well on this standard, poorly on this standard.  These students, progress has stalled, these students are improving, these students are falling behind.
    And this, like, idea really started to take hold of our teachers.  They would tell other teachers about CommonLit.  Sometimes we peek in on these Facebook groups for ELA teachers, teachers teaching English.  And I'm learning all kinds of acronyms now that I'm in the tech world.  Teachers loved working with this.  There were other options, but a lot of them were paid products.  And I think teachers maybe didn't trust that it was built by teachers for teachers.
    So, let's look at the growth of what happened.  So, for a long time there weren't a lot of users.  And then this is - this is middle of 2017.  This is January 1, 2018.  And this is last week.  So, we hit 3 million registered accounts just before the end of the year.  And now we're at 6.89 million accounts.  It's actually a little scary sometimes.
    But you can see that after like two years of building this grassroots constituency and solely spreading CommonLit through like direct appeal and word of mouth, like the sort of effect of critical mass started to build up use around the product.  And it's great that we found traction and that teachers and students really love CommonLit.  What's not quite as great is that as a nonprofit I now have to figure out how to pay for server resources to run all of this.  We're going to serve 550 million requests from our web server this month.  And that's like about 30-40% higher than our highest traffic month last school year.  So, something happened this summer where a zillion people over the summer decided they're going to use CommonLit.  That's great, but also kind of scary.
    So, why do we have this traction?  I think it's because, like, teachers did the building for teachers.  So, like, two-thirds of CommonLit's team is former teachers and I think they really understand the challenges that teachers are facing in the classroom.  I think teachers trust us because they know that we have a bunch of teachers on our team.  And I think this is more important than anything we could do as designers or developers.  It's a really authentic connection.  If this were a startup, I would call it product market fit.  And I think it actually is product market fit, but the difference is that our market doesn't pay us for it.  They just participate in the product with us.
    So, we have a - we have a team in two offices.  We're in Washington, D.C. and through a pilot that Google.org is very generously funded with us, we've now opened an office in Mexico City.  We are building partnerships with schools in Mexico now.  Our goal is that we will eventually have regional offices that support coaching in major urban school districts to help teachers reach their full potential and impact student outcomes and lives.
    We started doing this in DC where we have a good relationship with DC public schools and with several charter schools in the area and we have - as of this August - we have a coaching team.  So, some of our teachers who used to be on curriculum writing are now full-time coaches.  So, they go into schools in the area and they're working with teachers.  They're either observing them in the classroom or they're working with them after class is over to help them use tools in the most impactful way.
    All right.  So, I want to talk a little bit about some of the fun stuff that we've done in 2018.  Probably the biggest thing that we did is we built a digital exam platform.  So, this is an extension of doing assignments.  I can't show the digital exams because I can't give away some of the confidential information that might appear in exams.  
    This summer we developed and launched an interim assessment tool that closely aligns with the state exams that are later taken.  But the questions are a bit more rigorous to make sure kids understand what they're reading.  The cool thing about this now is school districts can see how students are doing in an apples to apples comparison.  Not, this teacher is a good, easy grader or this teacher picked this assignments.  They're all doing the same thing.  They're short tests, meant to be in a period.  One in August and quarterly throughout the year to get an assessment where they are.
    This is from the design sprint we did on the dashboard that superintendents would use to see things.  That's our product strategist and one of the developers on my team.  Next thing we did, this is through the grant request Google, we built CommonLit Espanol.  Two things, we internationalized the application so it works in Spanish.  But the second part that was non-technical which was cool, we built up a corpus of Spanish text in the system.  The first 25 texts were translations from some of the most popular English language texts in CommonLit.  This summer we started getting the rights to like natively written in Spanish texts.  We now have 75 texts in Spanish and that will continue to grow over the next two and a half years.  And hopefully beyond.  But our grant runs for the next two and a half years.
    Our team in Mexico is working with the schools and it's a different educational environment in Mexico.  The curriculum in Mexico is a bit more regimented so teachers have less ability to choose what they do.  That's a challenge to work our way into the curriculum.  That's what we're working on right now.  For any who saw my CommonLit home page before, this is the same page in Spanish.  And this is our library with some Spanish text.
    Another thing we did this summer which was really cool, we started working on how we could build a richer text experience.  So, we built this really cool like parser and you know parser I guess, a serializer and a dumper.  But our curriculum team, the teachers who pull together curriculum, when we digitize it, we take the text and copy it into our application.  They're editing tiny MCE, getting the formatting right.  Some is articles and book excerpts, but a lot of it is poetry where the line break makes a massive difference.  We're very careful how we format that.
    We store it as HTML, and it's parsed into a JSON tree of nodes, the tag type, metadata, the actual text that's displayed.  You might ask, why would we go through all this pain?  Doing this allows us to - we can take this JSON and then rehydrate with HTML at render time.  And this lets us do things, we can inject questions or footnotes directly into the text.  It also allow us to do things like selections that span paragraphs or parts of paragraphs.
    And that allows us to do annotations which is the next big feature that we're working on.  So, part of a student's assignment might be to read a text and annotate it.  Look for where they're going arguments.  I think the author is trying to get at this here.  This is a trig their sort of points to the author having an axe to grind on this particular topic or something like that.
    And then the - this ability to do selections across paragraphs also puts us in a position to build better versions of read aloud and translation.  And I not being a teacher myself, I didn't realize how important having reading text translation, they can grab any portion in CommonLit and translate it into 13 different languages.  For students where English is not their first language, or maybe English isn't spoken in the home, this is a really powerful thing for helping them sort of get their footing so they can learn the text.
    And it's a major component of IEPs which are like individual education programs.  This is something for students who are struggling to help them get back on track.  This is a little snippet of what the deconstructed text might look like.  So, you can just sort of see like we pull it apart and there's some metadata on it and you can see the text.  And that all gets reassembled on the page when teachers and students look at things.
    Another thing that we've been working really hard at it building deeper partnerships.  So, historically CommonLit was always grassroots.  So the use was driven by teachers.  Joining program was - like, a teacher decided to use CommonLit and hopefully they would pass the word on to other teachers.  But now we have the ability for a school or a school district to say you know what?  We want to make CommonLit an official part of our curriculum.  We want to roster all of our teachers and roster all the students.  And this to us is really, really important.  It prevents things like a student with two accounts in the system so you can't pull the data together at the end of the year and see the impact.  Sometimes, for example, in the past before we did whole-school rostering, if a teacher forgot the password and couldn't figure it out, we don't require email addresses for students.  If there was no way to log in, the teacher would create a new account and there's an orphaned student account hanging out.
    This is great.  We can do longitudinal studies.  We have a person on staff, a psychometrician, a person who studies tests.  A person who creates tests whose questions and answers are valid.  That's something I learned this year.  For us, like these partnerships with districts are a huge way to amplify the impact we can have.  In some ways these relationships with school districts entail extra services they do pay that funds our operations.  And one of the frightening things, I really felt this before when people were talking about granters, the big philanthropists often want to parachute in and drop big moneybags on you and then peace out, and then don't want you to ask them for money again.
    You can imagine as you go through the landscape of major donors that you're sort of scorching the Earth and watching this cliff approach of like, hmmm.  I've asked all the 25 biggest players for money.  Where are we going to fund our operations next year?  We have something we can do with school districts.  Because we're a nonprofit, we can provide services at a much, much lower price point than commercial options could.  And it ends up being a net win for us and help us be sustainable and helps us provide things that struggling school districts don't have.
    So, if any of you haven't watched Matt Mitchell's talk that inspired Software with a Mission, I highly recommend doing so.  It's really, really amazing.  One of the things that when I listened to his talk that really hit me, him talking about thinking about the things that you have and to take action and bring your value to the table.  So, you know, you almost certainly have some special knowledge that you can bring that would benefit a nonprofit team.  For me, the things that I brought were like CommonLit's engineering team had done amazing things.  But they were for the most part pretty low on years of experience.  So, I was able to bring some software process knowledge in that like helps make us more reliable and a little bit more efficient.
    And also let people do thing like deploy with greater confidence.  But also things like I used to work at Thoughtbot and we did a lot of work with early stage startups.  I learned a lot how to build the bare minimum thing to get it out the door to test an idea.  And that's a thing, if you haven't been in a startup before, you maybe don't have experience with lean product launches.  Those were examples of things I was able to do.
    I'm sure from all of your experience in really cool things, things that you could do.  It's important not to underestimate the impact that you can have like finding a place where a particular skill that you have might be lacking.  It's like a force multiplier, right?  It's like a big amplifier of the impact you can have if the current baseline for your skill is actually low.
    So, don't underestimate how much impact your time and your focus can have.  In DC we have this sort of joke about revolving door, they come in and work for government and then work for private industry and then work for government in the industry that they were regulated for.  There is good reasons for that, people in government really understand how the outside world works.  But I think people should consider having a couple points in their career where they stop doing commercial work and go and work for a nonprofit for a bit.
    I have been at CommonLit for eight months and I've really loved it.  And I - it's been personally rewarding in a way that I didn't think I would anticipate when I came.  Sometimes when we fix bug reports, like teacher - when we tell the teachers that the bug is fixed they write us like these incredibly nice notes back and it feels really nice.  We also - I was telling someone earlier today - we get letters from people who are incarcerated talking about how this is like the only way that they have access to anything like worthwhile to read because of rules about like what books they can purchase while they're in prison.
    So, this isn't just helping kids.  This is helping adults too.  And I know it's I think finding something where you feel like you're doing good within the organization and also doing good outside the organization can be really fulfilling.  So, I highly recommend that you consider doing something like this.  So, I wanted to thank Matt Mitchell who I hoped would be here.  But he's not, for his talk.  And Bridget and Sean for considering me to come and speak and CommonLit for putting money in my bank account twice a month and all of you for listening.
    This is the National Book Fair, it's in DC.  Highly recommend you check it out, it's Labor Day weekend every year.  And that is Matthew Cordell, my favorite illustrator.  And his books are funny and good and strong female characters, I think modeled on his daughter.  And they're funny for adults as well as kids.  You should check them out.  I'm Geoff Harcourt on Twitter, Geoff@commonLit.org.  And you should come and speak in DC.  And I'm hiring.  So if you want to come work with me, hit me up.  Thank you very much.
    [ Applause ]
    Oh, yeah.  Does anyone have any questions?
    AUDIENCE: I'm just kind of curious.  How was your internationalization process?
    GEOFF: It was - it took a lot of work.  It was kind of a crash effort because we just decided to like try to do it in a hurry.  So, we split every page up.  So, every React template and every ERB template for Rails in our system got split up amongst the team.  We went through them together and did them one by one.
    A person on our team wrote a layer that allows translations to be shared between Rails and React pretty smoothly.  JS also does it.  We're using it, but we needed extra secret sauce.  And then we now have like an audit routine.  So, if anyone adds any English and forgets to add Spanish, the build fails.  So, that helps us make sure we're not blowing things up.  And our tests blow up if there's missing translations.  I actually think there's all kinds of great reasons to do internationalization, even if you only run your app in English.  I like putting keys into the text, so when copy changes, tests don't blow up.  I think for us it's been a very positive thing.  Yeah.  Any other questions?
    AUDIENCE: [ Away from microphone ]
    GEOFF: I pursued CommonLit as a client for Thoughtbot for two years.  And when Michelle showed me what she was working on and I asked how much money she had to build the things she wanted to build.  I'm not going to say the words because some are not appropriate.  But the words, "You blanking crazy" were used.  And then she actually went and did it.  Now I work for her.  So, she showed me.
    But, yeah, I do think it's like, you know, there's like value in pragmatism, but there's also value in being ambitious and dreaming.  So, you know, I think sometimes I'm like a pessimist.  So, it's good to sort of sometimes be shown that, you know, maybe I'm constraining my world a little too much.  Anyone else?
    AUDIENCE: So, you mentioned that you provide automated translations in 13 languages.
    GEOFF: Yeah.
    AUDIENCE: Is that sourced through machine learning or -
    GEOFF: No.  It's  - currently we do it through an API.  So, the - it's not one of the major ones that you probably have heard of.  We have plans to move to our own system so that we can do a little bit of like advanced translation and make sure some things are a little bit more idiomatic.  But in a lot of cases we found through like analytics that the things that kids are trying to translate, it's not actually a whole sentence.  It's like some word that they're stuck on.  And actually like a great example of this was we did a user interview with a student who read at a pretty high level but just didn't know what the word rugby was.
    And he was reading a story that took place in like Great Britain in 1910 and they were talking about rugby.  He was frustrated.  It was a cultural context he didn't have exposure to.  He didn't understand why it was so important.  That's kind of an example of how having like a little extra context around what goes on makes a big difference in kids' ability to understand what they're reading.
    A lot of the stuff that CommonLit does really well is that text has supporting materials around them either in the form of images or videos.  We're launching what we call close reading mode next year, next calendar year, which is going to have a lot of pre-reading activities where students learn vocab words or something about the period they're about to read about so they can have context about what they're going to read more.
    AUDIENCE: In that specific situation where the kid didn't know what rugby was, do you have something built in like a dictionary?
    GEOFF: Yeah.  There's a dictionary.  That's actually provided by the same company.  They're called Speech Dream.  They very generously provided their product to us in free in exchange for us promoting them.  And then we became 90% of their traffic and almost killed them.  So, they are not thrilled about our hockey stick-shaped growth curve, but they were very nice and negotiated with us a graceful roll off.  So, we're replacing their services one by one with things we've written ourselves.  Yeah.  Cool.  Anyone else?  Okay.  Thank you so much.
